# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

This Power BI project extracts data from a CSV file, cleans it, and transforms it into meaningful insights through interactive reports. The dashboard consists of three key reports:

Reports Included:
Sales Overview – Provides a high-level view of total sales, revenue trends, and key performance indicators.
Customer Details – Analyzes customer demographics, purchase behavior, and segmentation.
Product Details – Displays product-wise sales performance, best-selling items, and revenue contribution.

Data Processing:
Data is extracted from CSV files.
Cleaning and transformation steps include handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating calculated fields.
Power BI is used to visualize insights effectively.
